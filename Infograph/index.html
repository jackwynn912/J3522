<h2> Reported Complaints Pertaining to Student Loans
</h2>

<h5> <i> By Jack Wynn </i></h5>
<br>

Following the lawsuit against Navient Corporation, there has been added attention to the nature of complaints being filed which pertain to student loans. The current student loan system aims to provide financial aid to those in need, however many have recently experienced issues with how their loans were being handled and paid back. For these reasons we have seen student loans become a significant talking point in government, as necessary action continues to be disputed. By categorizing these complaints, we gain a deeper understanding of what makes these issues so significant. Below we see an analysis of the 36,871 complaints that have been filed relating to student loans based on the Issue the complaint relates to.

Above we see the many different classifications available for student loan complaints that come in. The most prevalent complaint relates to dealing with a lender or servicer. This is significant because it is likely as a result of complications that may or may not be within the lender’s control. In addition to this, complaints may be about the personal interactions themselves rather than the loan system. The lowest category of complaints pertained to actually getting a loan. This is encouraging because it suggests people have had an easier time receiving one.

Shown above is a bar graph separating the same complaints by the category’s sub-issues. As is clearly displayed, far more of the complaints are related to federal student loan servicing compared to those about private student loans. This is significant because it connects to how many more people are likely involved in federal programs while private ones are still seeing issues arise. This is something that will be looked into and further discussed.
