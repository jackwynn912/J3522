So what makes LeBron the greatest player of all time? For many fans, it's because of his resilience. LeBron faced many hardships at the start of his career. Growing up in Akron, LeBron viewed basketball as his way out, a chance to make a name for himself and for his mom. Despite the financial stability being in the NBA provided, from a basketball standpoint, the Cavaliers were as unstable as you could get. Despite dealing with bad ownership and underperforming teammates, LeBron still brought the Cavaliers to the finals and won two MVP awards. He fully established himself during his time with the Heat when he won two titles, two more MVPs and made the finals all four years he played there. In fact, between Miami, his second stint in Cleveland, and his time with the Lakers, LeBron brought every new team he joined a championship. When you combine these feats with his historic athleticism and knowledge of the game, you get the greatest player ever.
